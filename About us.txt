I started making threadjewellery when I travelled to south america in 2010. Some techniques 
I have picked up on the street with the help from other streetartists and some I've developed 
on my own.


MANUFACTURING

All my jewellery er made from brass thread. The threads are connected by pressue, which means
no soldering. By using this technique, the thread end-points often turn out to spirals,
while other threads are used to wrap-around to make to spirals more permanent.
The threads are then hammered to make the structure tougher and more stabil.
Besides a hammer, an assortment of small pliers and saws are used. Nothing is glued together.


INSPIRATION

When you make jewellery by thread, the threads are often transformed into spirals and that's 
why they are a recurring theme for my pieces. I like to create jewellery with geometrical
figures & symbols.

My jewellery might seem familiar to what you can see in other cultures and time-periods,
namely because of the widespread use of threads and spirals in many different regions of 
the world through time.


SPIRALS

Spirals have been akin to a red thread through humanities history and shows how different
cultures have a common heritage. Some of the earliest references to spirals are ingravings
in stone monuments that date at least 11000 bc. Through hustory the sprials have had different
intepretations, many of them referring to a cycling nature. Similiar to the cycle of life
that stretches between birth and death. The circadian cycle that goes from day to night. 
The cycle of year that goes from summer to winter then back to summer. 
The spiral is a progressive symbol, that means change as well as being the symbol of cosmos and the 
sun.


In the same fashion that galaxies in outerspace take the shape of spirals, spirals occur naturally 
here on earth. For an unkown reason some plants grow in spiral formation, a fenomanon
Leonardo Fibonacci tried explaining i the 1800 with his famous fibonacci sequens.
